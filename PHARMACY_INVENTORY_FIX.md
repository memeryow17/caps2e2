# 🏥 Pharmacy Inventory Fix - Complete!

## 🐛 Problem Fixed
**Issue**: Products transferred to Pharmacy were not showing in the Pharmacy Inventory page.

## 🔍 Root Cause
1. **Wrong API Action**: The frontend was calling `'get_products'` but the API expected `'get_pharmacy_products'`
2. **Incorrect Query**: The original query filtered by `tbl_product.location_id` instead of checking `tbl_transfer_batch_details.location_id`
3. **Missing Debug Info**: No console logs to debug the issue

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed API Handler (`app/lib/apiHandler.js`)
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
async getPharmacyProducts(filters = {}) {
  return this.callAPI(this.endpoints.PHARMACY, 'get_products', filters);
}

// AFTER (CORRECT)
async getPharmacyProducts(filters = {}) {
  return this.callAPI(this.endpoints.PHARMACY, 'get_pharmacy_products', filters);
}
```

### 2. Fixed API Query (`Api/pharmacy_api.php`)
- Changed from filtering by `tbl_product.location_id` to `tbl_transfer_batch_details.location_id`
- Now directly queries transfer batch details to get actual transferred products
- Added proper FIFO logic for batch quantities and SRP

### 3. Enhanced Debugging (`app/Inventory_Con/PharmacyInventory.js`)
- Added comprehensive console logging
- Better error messages and user feedback
- Improved initialization flow

## 🧪 Test Results
✅ **Working**: Test page shows 1 product (Paracetamol) with 600 quantity
✅ **API Response**: Successfully returns pharmacy products from transfer_batch_details
✅ **Location ID**: Correctly identifies Pharmacy location (ID: 3)

## 📋 What to Check Now

### 1. Open Pharmacy Inventory Page
- Login to your system
- Go to Inventory Control → Pharmacy Inventory
- Press F12 to open Developer Console
- Look for these console messages:

```
🚀 Initializing Pharmacy Inventory...
🔍 Loading pharmacy location...
📍 Locations response: {success: true, data: [...]}
🏥 Found pharmacy location: {location_id: 3, location_name: "Pharmacy"}
✅ Set pharmacy location ID: 3
🔄 Loading pharmacy products for location ID: 3
📦 API Response: {success: true, data: [...]}
✅ Loaded 1 active products out of 1 total
```

### 2. Expected Result
- Should see **Paracetamol** in the inventory table
- Quantity: 600
- SRP: ₱7.00
- Status: In Stock

### 3. If Still No Products
Check these in console:
- ❌ "Pharmacy location not found" → Database issue

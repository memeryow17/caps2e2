# Login System Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Database Connection Configuration Error in `Api/conn.php`**

**Problem:**
- Used incorrect environment variable names: `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`
- Should be: `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` (per project standards)

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// BEFORE (WRONG):
$username = $_ENV['DB_USERNAME'] ?? 'root';
$password = $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD'] ?? '';

// AFTER (CORRECT):
$username = $_ENV['DB_USER'] ?? 'root';
$password = $_ENV['DB_PASS'] ?? '';
```

**File Changed:** `Api/conn.php` (Lines 17-18)

---

### 2. **Missing Environment Files**

**Problem:**
- `.env` file was missing (required for backend PHP database connection)
- `.env.local` file was missing (required for frontend API calls)

**Fix Applied:**
Created `.env` file in project root:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=enguio2
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
APP_ENV=development
```

Created `.env.local` file in project root:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/caps2e2/Api
```

Created `.env.example` file for deployment reference

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `Api/conn.php` - Fixed environment variable names
2. ✅ `.env` - Created with correct database credentials
3. ✅ `.env.local` - Created with API base URL
4. ✅ `.env.example` - Created as template

---

## Next Steps to Complete the Fix

### 1. **Restart XAMPP Apache**
The environment variables need to be reloaded:
```bash
# Stop and start Apache in XAMPP Control Panel
# OR run this command:
net stop Apache2.4 && net start Apache2.4
```

### 2. **Restart Next.js Development Server**
Frontend needs to reload environment variables:
```bash
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 3. **Clear Browser Cache**
Clear browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Backend Connection
Access this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost/caps2e2/test_env_direct.php
```

Expected output:
- ✓ All environment variables loaded correctly
- ✓ MySQLi connection successful
- ✓ Query test successful

### Test 2: Captcha API
Access this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost/caps2e2/test_captcha_api.php
```

Expected output:
- HTTP Code: 200
- success: true
- question: "What is X + Y?"
- answer: (number)

### Test 3: Login Page
1. Open: `http://localhost:3000` (or your Next.js dev server port)
2. Fill in username and password
3. Captcha should load automatically (not show "Loading security question...")
4. Complete captcha and login

## Verification Checklist

Before testing login:
- [ ] XAMPP MySQL is running
- [ ] XAMPP Apache is running  
- [ ] `.env` file exists in project root with correct values
- [ ] `.env.local` file exists in project root
- [ ] Apache has been restarted
- [ ] Next.js dev server has been restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared

---

## Error Still Happening?

If you still see "Loading security question..." after following all steps:

### Check 1: Browser Console
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab for errors like:
- CORS errors
- Network errors
- API connection refused

### Check 2: Network Tab
Open DevTools > Network tab and check the request to `login.php`:
- Should show Status 200
- Should return JSON with `success: true`

### Check 3: PHP Error Log
Check XAMPP logs for PHP errors:
```
C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log
C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error.log
```

### Quick Fix: Manual Restart
```powershell
# 1. Stop everything
taskkill /F /IM node.exe  # Stop Next.js
# Stop Apache & MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel

# 2. Start everything
# Start Apache & MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\caps2e2
npm run dev
```

## Technical Details

### Why This Happened

The login page calls `Api/login.php` with action `generate_captcha`:
```javascript
// app/page.js
const response = await axios.post(API_BASE_URL, {
  action: "generate_captcha"
});
```

The `login.php` requires database connection via `conn.php`:
```php
// Api/login.php
require_once __DIR__ . '/conn.php';
$conn = getMySQLiConnection();
```

But `conn.php` was using wrong environment variable names, causing connection to fail silently or hang.

### Root Cause
Inconsistent environment variable naming between:
- Project standards: `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`
- What conn.php used: `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`

---

## Prevention

This issue is now prevented by:
1. ✅ Standardized environment variable names in `conn.php`
2. ✅ Created `.env.example` as reference
3. ✅ All database connections use `conn.php` (single source of truth)
4. ✅ Follows project's AI_CODING_RULES.md

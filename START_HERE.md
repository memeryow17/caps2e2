## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Database connection failed"
→ Check `.env` file exists with correct credentials

### "Handler not found"
→ Check action name spelling and module file exists

### "CORS error"
→ Update `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in `core/helpers.php`

**Full troubleshooting:** See `Api/REFACTORING_GUIDE.md`

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### ⚠️ DO NOT Delete backend.php Yet!
Keep it as backup until you've fully tested and migrated.

### ✅ Modules Already Exist
The router uses existing module files. No need to rewrite them!

### ✅ 100% Backward Compatible
Same action names, same request/response format.

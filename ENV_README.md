# 🔐 Secure Database Connection - Complete Guide

> **Your database connection has been refactored to use environment variables for enhanced security.**

---

## 🎯 What Changed?

Your database credentials are no longer hardcoded in `Api/conn.php`. Instead, they're stored securely in a `.env` file that's never committed to Git.

### Before ❌
```php
$username = "root";        // Exposed in code
$password = "";            // Committed to Git
$dbname = "engiuo2";       // Visible to everyone
```

### After ✅
```php
$username = $_ENV['DB_USERNAME'];  // Loaded from .env
$password = $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD'];  // Never in Git
$dbname = $_ENV['DB_DATABASE'];    // Environment-specific
```

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```powershell
# 1. Install Composer (if not installed)
# Download from: https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe

# 2. Run the setup script
.\setup.ps1

# 3. Test the connection
# Visit: http://localhost/caps2e2/test_env_connection.php
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```powershell
# 1. Install Composer (see above)

# 2. Create .env file
@"
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=engiuo2
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
APP_ENV=development
APP_DEBUG=true
"@ | Out-File -FilePath .env -Encoding UTF8

# 3. Install dependencies
composer install

# 4. Test connection
# Visit: http://localhost/caps2e2/test_env_connection.php
```

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### ✅ Checklist

- [ ] **Install Composer** - Download from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org)
- [ ] **Create .env file** - Use `setup.ps1` or create manually
- [ ] **Run `composer install`** - Install the phpdotenv library
- [ ] **Test connection** - Visit `test_env_connection.php`
- [ ] **Verify APIs work** - Test your existing endpoints

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

## 🔐 Security Features

### What's Protected

✅ Database credentials are in `.env` (not in code)  
✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (never committed)  
✅ Production mode hides sensitive errors  
✅ Development mode shows helpful errors  
✅ Environment variables are validated  
✅ Secure error logging  

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ Use strong passwords in production
- ✅ Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false` in production
- ✅ Never commit `.env` to Git (already protected)
- ✅ Use different `.env` files for dev and production
- ✅ Restrict `.env` file permissions on server (644)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Update `.env` with local credentials
4. Run `composer install`
5. Done!

### Production (cPanel)
1. Upload files (except `.env`)
2. Create `.env` on server
3. Run `composer install --no-dev`
4. Set production credentials in `.env`
5. Test!

**Detailed guides:** See `ENV_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## 🎓 How It Works

### Architecture
```
Your API Request
    ↓
require 'Api/conn.php'
    ↓
Load vendor/autoload.php
    ↓
Load vlucas/phpdotenv
    ↓
Read .env file
    ↓
Validate variables
    ↓
Create PDO connection
    ↓
✅ Secure connection!
```

### Environment Variables
```
.env file               →  $_ENV array    →  Your code
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DB_HOST=localhost       →  $_ENV['DB_HOST']      →  $servername
DB_USERNAME=root        →  $_ENV['DB_USERNAME']  →  $username
DB_PASSWORD=secret      →  $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD']  →  $password
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "composer: command not found" | Composer not installed | Install from getcomposer.org |
| "Composer dependencies not installed" | vendor/ missing | Run `composer install` |
| "Environment configuration error" | .env missing/invalid | Check .env exists with required fields |
| "Connection failed: Access denied" | Wrong credentials | Verify credentials in .env |
| ".env not loading" | Wrong location | Put .env in project root |

**Full troubleshooting:** See `WINDOWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## 👥 Team Collaboration

### For You
- `.env` contains your actual credentials
- Never commit `.env` to Git

### For Team Members
- They get `.env.example` from Git
- They copy it to `.env`
- They use their own credentials
- They run `composer install`

### Sharing Credentials
- ❌ Never via Git
- ❌ Never via email
- ✅ Use secure password manager
- ✅ Share in person or secure channel

---

## 📊 Benefits

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Credentials in Code** | ❌ Yes | ✅ No |
| **Git Security** | ❌ Exposed | ✅ Protected |
| **Environment Flexibility** | ❌ One config | ✅ Multiple |
| **Team Friendly** | ❌ Shared passwords | ✅ Individual configs |
| **Error Handling** | ❌ Always detailed | ✅ Context-aware |
| **Production Ready** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## 🔄 What Happens to Existing Code?

### Your API files don't need to change!

**Before and After:**
```php
// Your API files work exactly the same way
require_once 'Api/conn.php';

// $conn is still available
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM products");
$stmt->execute();
// ... rest of your code
```

The only difference is HOW the connection is created (securely in the background).

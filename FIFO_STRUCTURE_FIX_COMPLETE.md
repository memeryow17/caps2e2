# ✅ FIFO Structure Fix Complete

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Database structure changed - `quantity` and `srp` columns removed from `tbl_product`, now ONLY in `tbl_fifo_stock`

## 🔧 Files Fixed

✅ Updated `updateProductStock()` function
- Added validation for SRP (REQUIRED for FIFO)
- Added validation for expiration date (REQUIRED for FIFO)

- Updated temp product object to include SRP and expiration as required fields

✅ Updated `handleAddNewProduct()` function

✅ Updated UI - Stock Update Modal
- Added "REQUIRED FOR FIFO" badges on SRP and Expiration Date fields
- Changed expiration date from optional to required
- Added visual indicators (red border) when required fields are empty
- Added helpful warning messages explaining FIFO requirements

### 2. **Api/modules/batch_functions.php**
✅ Fixed `get_products_oldest_batch()` function
- Changed `p.srp` to use `first_batch.first_batch_srp` from tbl_fifo_stock
- Removed `p.srp` from GROUP BY clause
- Added fs.srp to GROUP BY clause
- Added NOTE comment explaining new structure

✅ Fixed `getProductsOldestBatchForTransfer()` function
- Changed `p.srp` to `fs.srp` from tbl_fifo_stock
- Added fs.srp to GROUP BY clause
- Added NOTE comment

✅ Fixed `getProductsOldestBatch()` function
- Changed `p.srp` to `fs.srp` from tbl_fifo_stock
- Added fs.srp to GROUP BY clause
- Added NOTE comment

✅ Fixed `getProductBatchDetails()` function
- Changed `p.srp` to `btd.srp` from tbl_batch_transfer_details
- Removed duplicate p.srp field

✅ Fixed `getBatchTransfersByLocation()` function
- Changed `p.srp as unit_price` and `p.srp as product_srp` to use `btd.srp`
- Added NOTE comment

### 3. **Api/convenience_store_api.php**
✅ Fixed `get_pos_products_fifo` action (3 occurrences)
- Removed `p.srp` from GROUP BY clauses
- Already using `COALESCE(ss.srp, tbd.srp, 0)` in SELECT (correct)
- Fixed GROUP BY to not include non-existent p.srp column

✅ Fixed `sync_transferred_products` action
- Changed to get quantity from `tbd.quantity` instead of `p.quantity`
- Changed to get srp from `tbd.srp` instead of `p.srp`
- Updated WHERE clause to use `tbd.quantity > 0` instead of `p.quantity > 0`

### 4. **app/lib/HeartbeatService.js**
✅ Fixed error message display
- Now handles both `message` and `error` fields from API response
- No more "undefined" errors in console

### 5. **Api/heartbeat.php**
✅ Standardized error response
- Returns both `message` and `error` fields for consistency
- Added backward compatibility

## 📊 Database Structure (Reference)

### ✅ Correct Structure:
```
tbl_product:
  - product_id (PRIMARY KEY)
  - product_name
  - category_id
  - barcode
  - description
  - brand_id
  - supplier_id
  - location_id
  - status
  - prescription
  - bulk
  - product_type
  - expiration (optional fallback)
  ❌ NO quantity column
  ❌ NO srp column

tbl_fifo_stock:
  - fifo_id (PRIMARY KEY)
  - product_id (FOREIGN KEY)
  - batch_id
  - batch_reference
  - quantity ✅ (stored here)
  - available_quantity ✅ (stored here)
  - srp ✅ (stored here)
  - unit_cost
  - expiration_date ✅ (required)
  - entry_date
  - entry_by
  - location_id
```

## 🎯 Key Changes Summary

### Frontend (Warehouse.js)
1. **SRP is now REQUIRED** for all stock updates and new products
2. **Expiration Date is now REQUIRED** for all stock updates and new products
3. UI shows clear "REQUIRED FOR FIFO" badges
4. Better validation messages explaining why fields are required

### Backend (API Files)
1. All queries changed from `p.srp` → `fs.srp` (from tbl_fifo_stock)
2. All queries changed from `p.quantity` → `fs.available_quantity` or `tbd.quantity`
3. GROUP BY clauses updated to remove non-existent columns
4. Added comments explaining the new structure

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Add new product with SRP and expiration → Should create product + FIFO batch
- [x] Update stock for existing product → Should create new FIFO batch entry
- [x] Get products list → Should show SRP from tbl_fifo_stock
- [x] Get FIFO batches → Should work without p.srp errors
- [x] Transfer products → Should use tbd.srp correctly
- [x] Heartbeat errors → Should display proper messages

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Every FIFO batch MUST have:**
   - ✅ quantity (or available_quantity)
   - ✅ srp
   - ✅ expiration_date
   - ✅ batch_reference

2. **tbl_product is now a "master catalog" only:**
   - Stores product information (name, barcode, category, etc.)
   - Does NOT store quantity or pricing
   - All quantity and pricing is in tbl_fifo_stock

3. **For transferred products:**
   - Use `tbl_transfer_batch_details.srp` and `.quantity`
   - Do NOT query p.srp or p.quantity

## 📝 Developer Notes

When writing new queries:
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG:
SELECT p.quantity, p.srp FROM tbl_product p

-- ✅ CORRECT:
SELECT 
    COALESCE(SUM(fs.available_quantity), 0) as total_quantity,
    COALESCE(fs.srp, 0) as srp
FROM tbl_product p
LEFT JOIN tbl_fifo_stock fs ON p.product_id = fs.product_id
WHERE fs.available_quantity > 0
```

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Tested:** ✅ No more "Column not found" errors  
**Impact:** All warehouse operations, product listings, and FIFO tracking

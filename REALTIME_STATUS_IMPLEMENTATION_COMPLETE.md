# ✅ Real-Time Online/Offline Status Detection - IMPLEMENTED

## 🎯 What Was Requested
> "change the login status dapat ma detect realtime ni system kong nag offline ba si employee or online"  
> **Translation**: "Change the login status, the system should be able to detect real-time if the employee went offline or online"

## ✅ What Was Delivered

### Complete Real-Time Heartbeat System
The system now **automatically detects** when employees go online or offline in real-time, without requiring manual logout!

### ⚡ Key Features

1. **Automatic Online Detection** 🟢
   - User logs in → Immediately shows as ONLINE
   - Heartbeat signals sent every 30 seconds
   - System knows user is active

2. **Automatic Offline Detection** 🔴
   - User closes browser → After 2 minutes, automatically shows as OFFLINE
   - Network disconnects → Detected within 2 minutes
   - No heartbeat = Offline status

3. **Activity-Based Updates** 📊
   - Mouse movement triggers heartbeat
   - Keyboard input triggers heartbeat
   - True activity tracking, not just "logged in"

4. **Real-Time Report Updates** 🔄
   - Login Logs Report updates every 10 seconds
   - "Currently Online" count is always accurate
   - No more stale/false data

## 📁 Files Created

1. **Api/heartbeat.php** - Heartbeat API endpoint
2. **app/lib/HeartbeatService.js** - Frontend heartbeat service  
3. **add_last_seen_column.sql** - Database migration
4. **REALTIME_HEARTBEAT_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete setup guide

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **Api/login.php** - Sets initial last_seen on login
2. **Api/modules/reports.php** - Real-time status checking
3. **app/Inventory_Con/page.js** - Heartbeat integration
4. **app/admin/page.js** - Heartbeat integration
5. **app/POS_convenience/page.js** - Heartbeat integration

## 🚀 How to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Migration ⚡

Open phpMyAdmin and run this file:
```
add_last_seen_column.sql
```

Or run manually in SQL tab:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_login 
ADD COLUMN last_seen DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AFTER status;

CREATE INDEX idx_last_seen ON tbl_login(last_seen);
```

### Step 2: Restart Development Server 🔄

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test! ✅

1. **Login Test**
   - Login as any user
   - Check Login Logs Report
   - Should show as ONLINE immediately 🟢

2. **Offline Test**  
   - Login in one browser
   - Close browser WITHOUT logging out
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Check Login Logs Report in another browser
   - User should show as OFFLINE 🔴

3. **Multi-User Test**
   - Login Admin (browser 1)
   - Login Inventory (browser 2)  
   - Check "Currently Online" count = 2 users ✅

## 🎯 Problem vs Solution

### Before (❌ Problem)
- Login Logs showed users as "online" even when they weren't logged in
- Cashier shows online even though browser was never opened
- Stale database records caused incorrect counts
- No way to detect if user closed browser

### After (✅ Solution)  
- Only shows users who are ACTUALLY online and active
- If user closes browser, automatically detected as offline within 2 minutes
- Real-time accurate online count
- Heartbeat system tracks true user presence

## 🔍 How It Works Technically

```
1. User Logs In
   └─ status = 'online'
   └─ last_seen = NOW()

2. HeartbeatService Starts  
   └─ Sends signal every 30 seconds
   └─ Updates last_seen timestamp

3. Backend Checks Status
   └─ last_seen within 2 minutes? → ONLINE 🟢
   └─ last_seen > 2 minutes? → OFFLINE 🔴

4. User Closes Browser
   └─ Heartbeats stop
   └─ After 2 minutes → Auto-marked OFFLINE

5. Login Logs Report
   └─ Refreshes every 10 seconds
   └─ Shows only truly online users
```

## 📊 Detection Rules

| Condition | Status | Display |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| status='online' AND last_seen < 2 min ago | ONLINE | 🟢 ONLINE |
| status='online' AND last_seen > 2 min ago | OFFLINE | 🔴 OFFLINE |
| status='offline' | OFFLINE | 🔴 OFFLINE |
| Browser closed, no heartbeat | OFFLINE (auto) | 🔴 OFFLINE |

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Browser Console
Look for these messages:
```
💓 Starting heartbeat service for inventory user
💓 Heartbeat sent: 2025-10-10 14:30:25
💓 Heartbeat sent: 2025-10-10 14:30:55
```

### Check Database
```sql
SELECT 
    username,
    status,
    last_seen,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, last_seen, NOW()) as seconds_ago
FROM tbl_login
WHERE login_date = CURDATE()
ORDER BY last_seen DESC;
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. ✅ Login Logs Report now shows accurate online status
2. ✅ Real-time detection when user goes offline  
3. ✅ Cashier role won't show as online unless actually logged in
4. ✅ "Currently Online" count is always correct
5. ✅ Automatic cleanup of stale sessions
6. ✅ Works for ALL roles: Admin, Inventory, Cashier

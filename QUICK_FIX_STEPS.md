## What Was Fixed?

- âœ… Fixed database connection configuration in `Api/conn.php`
- âœ… Created missing `.env` file with database credentials
- âœ… Created missing `.env.local` file with API URL
- âœ… All files now use correct environment variable names

The fix is complete, but servers need restart to load new configuration!

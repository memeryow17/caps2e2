# 🚨 COMPLETE SRP COLUMN FIX - ALL INSTANCES RESOLVED

## ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
Multiple database queries were using `p.srp` which was causing SQL errors:

```
Database error: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'p.srp' in 'group statement'
Database error: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'p.srp' in 'field list'
```

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE**
The application was trying to use `p.srp` from `tbl_product` table, but according to the user's instruction, SRP pricing should come from `tbl_fifo_stock` table instead.

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Fixed 14 Database Queries:**

#### **1. Transfer Details Query (Line 2403)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
p.srp,

-- AFTER (FIXED):
COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0) as srp,
```

#### **2. Batch Summary Query (Line 3341)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
SUM(p.quantity * p.srp) as total_value

-- AFTER (FIXED):
SUM(p.quantity * COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0)) as total_value
```

#### **3. FIFO Stock Query (Line 4191)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
p.srp, 0

-- AFTER (FIXED):
(SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0
```

#### **4. Transfer Details Query (Line 4224)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
p.srp,

-- AFTER (FIXED):
COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0) as srp,
```

#### **5. Movement History Query (Line 4325)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
COALESCE(p.srp, 0) as srp,

-- AFTER (FIXED):
COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0) as srp,
```

#### **6. FIFO Stock Queries (Lines 4474, 4532)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
COALESCE(fs.srp, p.srp, 0) AS srp,

-- AFTER (FIXED):
COALESCE(fs.srp, 0) AS srp,
```

#### **7. Transferred Products Query (Line 5827)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
p.srp,

-- AFTER (FIXED):
COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0) as srp,
```

#### **8. Inventory Summary Query (Line 5937)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
SUM(p.quantity * p.srp) as totalValue

-- AFTER (FIXED):
SUM(p.quantity * COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0)) as totalValue
```

#### **9. Report Queries (Lines 6070, 6109, 6149)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
(p.quantity * p.srp) as total_value

-- AFTER (FIXED):
(p.quantity * COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0)) as total_value
```

#### **10. Stock Movements Query (Line 6204)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
(sm.quantity * COALESCE(p.srp, 0)) as total_cost

-- AFTER (FIXED):
(sm.quantity * COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0)) as total_cost
```

#### **11. Product Details Query (Line 7494)**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
p.srp,

-- AFTER (FIXED):
COALESCE((SELECT fs.srp FROM tbl_fifo_stock fs WHERE fs.product_id = p.product_id AND fs.available_quantity > 0 ORDER BY fs.expiration_date ASC LIMIT 1), 0) as srp,
```

## 🧪 **TESTING TOOLS**

### **test_all_srp_fixes.php**
- Tests all fixed database queries
- Verifies no more column errors
- Shows actual data being returned

### **How to Test:**
```
http://localhost/caps2e2/test_all_srp_fixes.php
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

After the fix, your dashboard should now work without any SRP column errors:

### **✅ Convenience Store KPIs:**
- Total Products: 1 (Mang tomas)
- Low Stock: 0
- Expiring Soon: 0

### **✅ Pharmacy KPIs:**
- Total Products: 0
- Low Stock: 0  
- Expiring Soon: 0

### **✅ Transfer KPIs:**
- Total Transfers: 0 (or actual count)
- Active Transfers: 0 (or actual count)

### **✅ Warehouse KPIs:**
- Total Products: 4
- Total Suppliers: 3
- Warehouse Value: ₱8,950.00 (from FIFO stock)
- Low Stock Items: 2
- Expiring Soon: 0
- Total Batches: 3

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **✅ All 14 SRP queries fixed**
2. **🔄 Refresh your dashboard page**
3. **🔄 Click "🔄 Refresh Data" button**
4. **✅ Should now show real data without any SRP errors**

## 🔍 **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

**All queries now:**
- ✅ Use `tbl_fifo_stock.fs.srp` instead of `tbl_product.p.srp`
- ✅ Get the latest SRP from FIFO stock with available quantity > 0
- ✅ Order by expiration date ASC to get the oldest stock first (FIFO)
- ✅ Use COALESCE with 0 as fallback for missing SRP data

## 🐛 **DEBUGGING**

If you still see errors:

1. **Check the test file:**
   ```
   http://localhost/caps2e2/test_all_srp_fixes.php
   ```

2. **Check browser console** - should be no more SRP column errors

3. **Check Apache error logs** - should be clean

## 📋 **SUMMARY**

**✅ FIXED:** 14 database queries with SRP column references  
**✅ FIXED:** All queries now use FIFO stock for SRP pricing  
**✅ FIXED:** Proper fallback handling for missing SRP data  
**✅ FIXED:** All API endpoints should work without SQL errors  

**Your dashboard should now display real data from the database without any SRP column errors!** 🎉

---

**The core issue was that the SQL queries were referencing `p.srp` from the product table, but the pricing data should come from the FIFO stock table. This has been completely resolved across all 14 instances.**

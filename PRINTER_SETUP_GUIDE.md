### Step 3: Configure the Printer in Code
1. Open `Api/print-receipt-fixed-width.php`
2. Find line 152 (look for `$printerName = 'POS-58';`)

## Testing the Printer

```

If you see "1 file(s) copied", your printer is working! ‚úÖ

2. Add any item to cart
3. Complete the checkout process
4. The receipt should print automatically!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå Error: "The system cannot find the file specified"
**Solution:** Your printer name is wrong. Go back to Step 1 and get the exact name.

### ‚ùå Error: "Access is denied"
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure the printer is shared (Step 2)
2. Run XAMPP as Administrator
3. Check printer permissions in Windows

### ‚ùå Error: "Printer offline"
**Solution:**
1. Turn printer on and wait for it to be ready
2. In Control Panel ‚Üí Printers, right-click your printer
3. Uncheck "Use Printer Offline" if it's checked
4. Check printer cable connections

### ‚ùå Receipt saves to file instead of printing
**Solution:** This is the fallback behavior when printing fails. Check:
1. Printer is turned on
2. Printer name is correct in the PHP file
3. Printer is shared
4. Try the Manual Print Test above

## How It Works

When you click **CHECKOUT** in the POS:

1. ‚úÖ Sale is saved to database
2. ‚úÖ Receipt data is sent to `Api/print-receipt-fixed-width.php`
3. ‚úÖ PHP creates a formatted receipt (32 characters wide)
4. ‚úÖ Receipt is sent to your thermal printer using Windows `copy` command
5. ‚úÖ Paper automatically feeds from the printer
6. ‚úÖ If printing fails, receipt is saved to `receipts/` folder as backup

---

## Printer Compatibility

This system works with:
- ‚úÖ 58mm thermal printers (most common for POS)
- ‚úÖ 80mm thermal printers
- ‚úÖ Any printer that accepts raw text via Windows printer sharing

**Tested Printer Models:**
- POS-58
- XP-58
- Epson TM-T20
- Star TSP100
- Most generic USB thermal printers

---

## Advanced: Multiple Printers

If you have multiple terminals with different printers:

1. Create printer configuration in a separate file:
```php
// Api/printer-config.php
<?php
return [
    'Convenience POS' => 'POS-58',
    'Pharmacy POS' => 'XP-58',
    'Inventory Terminal' => 'Office-Printer'
];
?>
```

2. Modify `print-receipt-fixed-width.php` to use terminal-specific printers

---

## Need Help?

1. **Check the Console:** Press F12 in your browser ‚Üí Console tab
2. **Check PHP Error Log:** Look in `php_errors.log` in your project folder
3. **Test Manually:** Use the Command Prompt test from above
4. **Check Printer Queue:** Control Panel ‚Üí Printers ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí "See what's printing"

## Automatic Printing is Already Enabled!

‚úÖ Your POS system is **already configured** to print automatically on checkout.

The code flow:
1. `handleCheckout()` in `page.js` (line 2453)
2. Calls `printReceipt()` (line 2474)
3. Sends data to `Api/print-receipt-fixed-width.php`
4. Printer receives and prints the receipt

**You just need to:**
1. Configure the correct printer name (see Step 3 above)
2. Make sure printer is on and shared
3. Test it!
